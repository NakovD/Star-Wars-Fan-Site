            <p>Me? My name is David. I'm from Sofia. I like Star Wars(obviously), I like coding, playing games and booties(who doesnt? And I'm not talking about shoes.).</p>
            <p>I want to learn how to code and be able to earn money by doing it(aka I want to be programmer).Cause everyone wants to work someth that he likes, right?</p>
            <p>This site is my first project done only by myself(all ideas and resources are from me). It was a lot of fun(and not only fun) and I intend to keep working on it!</p>
            <p>If you find a bug or someth, please contact me on: <b>nakov_david@mail.bg</b>, so I can fix it. Thank you and have fun!</p>
